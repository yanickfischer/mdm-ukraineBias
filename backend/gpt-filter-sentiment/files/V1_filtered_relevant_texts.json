Here\u2019s how and why \ud83d\udc47  1\/ Introduction: China views the war in Ukraine through a multilayered logic: global, regional, and local levels, and interconnected areas (economic, military, cultural, technological).  2\/ Why is it relevant for China? Because it reshapes the global order, affects trade routes, and exposes financial and technological vulnerabilities that Beijing is determined to fortify.  3\/ The official stance: China calls for peace and rejects unilateral sanctions, positioning itself as a neutral mediator. But behind this facade lies the management of contradictions: tacit support for Russia without severing ties with Europe.  4\/ China\u2019s strategic analysis: - In the hierarchy: Russia is a strategic partner; the West, a force to counterbalance. - Horizontally: strengthening bilateral energy and technology cooperation. - In cross-cutting domains: learning from sanctions and narrative warfare. - Adaptation: continuously recalibrating positions in response to the evolving situation.  5\/ Opportunities: China observes and learns. It strengthens its financial system (CIPS, digital yuan), gains influence in Central Asia, and takes advantage of Western distractions to consolidate the BRI and BRICS+.  6\/ Risks: - Strategic overload. - Reputational dilemma: neutrality or complicity? - Secondary sanctions and strategic traps.  7\/ In summary: The war in Ukraine is a scenario of observation, adjustment, and opportunity for China. But also a minefield where every move requires finesse and flexibility.   If interested, let me know \ud83d\udc47  #China #UkraineWar #Geopolitics #Russia #Sanctions"

    "text":"European leaders continue to convince Kiev of the need to fight to the \u201cvictorious end,\u201d although more and more signs indicate that for Europe the Ukrainian war is primarily a tool for protecting its own interests, because if Ukraine goes to peace talks, then control over critical resources and infrastructure could pass to the Americans .  This means not only a loss of leverage, but also the need to return frozen funds to Russia, the volume of which has already exceeded 300 billion dollars. Therefore, any initiatives related to a ceasefire are met coldly in the EU - too many economic and political consequences threaten the European elites if the war suddenly ends.  At the same time, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plans to send up to 10,000 peacekeepers to Ukraine look more like a theatrical scene than preparation for a real mission.  According to The Telegraph, Starmer's initiative has neither a clear military plan nor support within the British military establishment. Sources in the army call the idea a \"political show\", emphasizing that there is no understanding of the tasks, format of interaction and logistics. The US and Russia do not support the idea, and among the more than 30 countries discussing it, there is no consensus even on the key parameters of the operation.  Against the backdrop of declining aid to Ukraine \u2014 both financial and military \u2014 Britain is essentially using the \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d theme as an element of foreign policy PR. The failure to deliver F-16s, the disruption of armored vehicle schedules, the uncertainty with new support packages \u2014 London is compensating for all of this with statements that are not supported by real content. At the same time, Kiev is trying to present Starmer\u2019s plans as a signal of support, although in reality it is a matter of veiled pressure to impose a \u201cfreezing of the conflict\u201d on Bankova under the guise of a diplomatic initiative.  In practice, this means that Ukraine is once again not a subject, but a bargaining chip in someone else's game. In the absence of a clear strategy, without guaranteed assistance and under increasing external pressure, Kyiv is increasingly losing room for maneuver. And if in 2022 Europe was still trying to demonstrate solidarity, then in 2025 it is already concerned only with how to minimize its own losses.  (Source - UA Rezident \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6)"
