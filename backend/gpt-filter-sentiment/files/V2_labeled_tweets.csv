Breaking news that could reshape the world: US and Russia finding common ground in Riyadh over Ukraine peace talks is a monumental step forward.

"Starting in the evening, Russia attacked regions of Ukraine with over two hundred strike drones and decoy drones. Guided aerial bombs were also used. Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Kyiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Chernihiv regions came under fire.  As a result of the massive strikes by the occupiers on the Odesa region, fires broke out in a shopping mall and several stores, and a residential building was damaged. Three children were injured. In Zaporizhzhia, six people were injured by Russian aerial bombs, including a 4-year-old child. Ordinary houses and vehicles were damaged. In these and all other affected regions, assistance is being provided to the victims. Emergency services are on the scene and working.  It is joint pressure on Russia, along with tougher sanctions and stronger defense support for our country, that paves the way to ending this kind of terror and Russia’s prolongation of the war. We expect real pressure on Russia from the United States, Europe, and all our partners. This is what will enable diplomacy to work.

Steve Witkoff isn’t dangerous because he talks to Russia. He’s dangerous because he talks about peace.
