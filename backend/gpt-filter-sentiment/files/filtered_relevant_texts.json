    "text":"Jessica Aber\u2019s death feels like one of those stories that\u2019s meant to fade quietly into the background \u2014 a tragic headline that people are supposed to forget. But when a career prosecutor who spent her life chasing Russian cybercriminals, CIA leaks, and war criminals turns up dead just weeks after resigning, forgetting isn\u2019t an option. Aber, the former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was found dead at her home in Alexandria on March 22. She was 43 years old. Police haven\u2019t said how she died, but the timing \u2014 and her unfinished business \u2014 makes it impossible to ignore. THE PROSECUTOR WHO WOULDN\u2019T BACK DOWN Jessica Aber wasn\u2019t just a lawyer \u2014 she was the person you sent in when things got messy. In January, just before her resignation, Aber helped put Asif Rahman, a former CIA analyst, behind bars for leaking top-secret information about Israeli military plans against Iran. The information ended up splashed across social media in October 2024. Aber didn\u2019t mince words when Rahman pleaded guilty. She warned that his leak had \u201cplaced lives at risk\u201d and \u201ccompromised our ability to collect vital intelligence in the future.\u201d That\u2019s prosecutor-speak for this guy seriously screwed things up. Whatever Rahman leaked, it wasn\u2019t just embarrassing \u2014 it was dangerous. BIG CASES, BIGGER ENEMIES Aber\u2019s cases didn\u2019t stop there. In November 2024, her office prosecuted a Virginia-based company accused of funneling sensitive U.S. technology to a Russian telecom firm with Kremlin ties. It wasn\u2019t exactly an accident \u2014 the company allegedly disguised shipments and played fast and loose with American tech that Russia wasn\u2019t supposed to have. Then there was the war crimes indictment. Aber\u2019s office charged four Russian-linked individuals with torturing and unlawfully detaining a U.S. national in Ukraine. She wasn\u2019t just making legal noise \u2014 she was putting serious pressure on powerful figures with deep connections. Aber\u2019s career was a parade of people you wouldn\u2019t want showing up at your funeral \u2014 oligarchs, cybercriminals, and corrupt players with resources to make problems disappear. A SUSPICIOUS EXIT Aber resigned in January 2025, just after Donald Trump returned to power. Nobody\u2019s said she was forced out, but resigning from one of the country\u2019s most powerful U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices weeks after jailing a rogue CIA analyst feels a little too clean. It\u2019s not hard to imagine why someone like Aber might suddenly find herself in a tight spot. Trump\u2019s return came with a wave of loyalty tests and DOJ shakeups \u2014 and Aber\u2019s aggressive pursuit of Russian networks and CIA leaks doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cteam player\u201d in this new political climate. If she was pressured to resign, what cases got quietly buried when she left? A SYSTEM THAT\u2019S GONE SOFT ON POWER The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in July 2024 handed Trump near-total immunity for \u201ccore presidential powers,\u201d including military command. Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that this decision could allow a president to order an assassination \u2014 and face no legal consequences. By the time Aber resigned, that ruling had already cast a long shadow over the Department of Justice. Prosecutors like Aber \u2014 the kind who took on powerful players with foreign connections \u2014 were now working in an environment where accountability had been gutted. If Aber\u2019s investigations had exposed something that threatened powerful interests, the court\u2019s ruling would have made it easier for those interests to apply pressure \u2014 or worse \u2014 without consequence. Her resignation may have been voluntary. It may not have been. But by the time Aber walked away from her post, the guardrails protecting prosecutors like her were already crumbling. WHAT DID ABER KNOW? Jessica Aber knew things that mattered \u2014 things that powerful people wanted buried. She chased down Russian cybercriminals, locked up a CIA leaker who compromised military intelligence, and tangled with foreign operatives who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make problems disappear. Now she\u2019s gone, and the timing stinks. Maybe her death was just an awful coincidence. Maybe it wasn\u2019t. But when the people investigating corruption start turning up dead, there\u2019s only one responsible thing to do: Start asking louder questions. Via MSNBC{News Junkies}"

Born into privilege, her rise reeks of nepotism, with scandals shes done a good job of insuring the client media keeps hidden. Her father, Ernst Albrecht, a CDU politician (the same party thats just taken power in germany) and Lower Saxony Minister \/President from 1976 to 1990, used huge inherited aristocratic wealth to secure  European Economic Community posts, gifting Ursula elite schools, Brussels roots, and insider access.   Just like his daughter, his anti-Russian mantra was Cold War standard, pro-NATO, anti-Moscow, Her grandfather, Carl Albrecht, a famous wealthy psychologist, lived off Bremen cotton riches and plantation ties. With a family thriving under Hitler\u2019s shadow, passing Ursula a loaded name. She married Heiko von der Leyen in 1986, joining a noble silk dynasty with estates like Bloemersheim Castle. a Nazi relative, Joachim Freiherr von der Leyen probably isn't the only dark secret from the period. Her wealth from her paternal side is Albrecht trade cash, von der Leyen land, plus a \u20ac300,000 EU salary, all keeping her seven kids in luxury.none of whom will ever see a battlefield.   She\u2019s fiercely anti-Russian, pushing to expand Germany\u2019s military and NATO as Defence Minister (2013\u20132019), then choking Russia with sanctions as Commission Chief. It\u2019s family doctrine, not vision. Her defence tenure was a cesspool: the \u201cconsultant scandal\u201d funnelled \u20ac150 million to McKinsey and pals like Katrin Suder, flouting rules with only \u20ac2.9 million declared. Two phones from that era, subpoenaed in 2019, were wiped clean \u201cfor security\u201d as she bolted to the EU, a blatant cover-up MPs like Tobias Lindner and Alexander M\u00fcller called criminal. The Gorch Fock ship refurb soared from \u20ac10 million to \u20ac135 million, waste she shrugged off while troops drilled with broomsticks. Then \u201cPfizergate\u201d: In 2021, she texted Pfizer\u2019s CEO for a \u20ac35 billion vaccine deal, 1.8 billion doses, no oversight. The texts? \u201cLost,\u201d she says.   The EU Ombudsman investigated, the EPPO probes corruption, and \u20ac4 billion in doses rot unused. She\u2019s untouchable,she plagiarized her thesis, but that's ignored, audits buried, evidence torched. Ursula\u2019s career is corruption incarnate.   She's in the top job due to vast privilege and her father\u2019s clout, grandfather\u2019s cash, husband\u2019s title hoisted her up. Anti-Russian Blood, not brains. Her Wealth? Inherited, not made. Scandals, defence theft, missing phones, and vaccine rip-offs all prove she\u2019s a crook, shielded by lineage. Europe\u2019s crippled with a rotten aristocrat as a \"leader\"   None of her wealthy relatives or political elite friends will die in the War they are so desperate to start with Russia.   That will be your and your families privilege, as is paying her huge salary and pension."

There must be more pressure on Russia to stop this terror. And that depends on all our partners\u2014the U.S., Europe, and others around the world.

Since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table\u2014and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this. Every night, every single day, it carries out the most cynical strikes. Without pressure on Russia, those in Moscow will continue to show contempt for real diplomacy and keep destroying lives.

    "text":". @michaeljohns lays out an excellent timeline of events that occurred over 24 years leading up to Russia's most recent invasion of Ukraine.   Before these events, which you should read, because I offer no redundancies, Ukraine had been part of Russia dating back to the 9th century. Kyiv is where the Nazis first attacked Russia in WWII.   After WWII, Ukraine became a part of the Soviet Bloc. When that broke up, instead of embracing Russia as we should have, we took advantage of it, as Michael lays out.   At the same time, Russia made Ukraine an autonomous state of Russia. Like Catalonia in Spain. During Bush's tenure, our CIA meddled in Ukraine's elections, which drove the first Russian incursion; from all indications, it was welcomed.   I was living in Europe during the second invasion under Obama there was a large percentage of the population that saw the president as a U.S. puppet and wanted to be Russian. Eighty percent of Ukrainians speak Russian.   When Kamala went to Europe and said, Ukraine would become a part of NATO, that was Russia's red line. One that they had made crystal clear for a very long time.   One has to ask, why didn't we make peace with Russia instead threatening them the way Michael laid out below."

Gerade diese Wortsch\u00f6pfung bem\u00fchten die US-amerikanische F\u00fchrung und die NATO, als sie milit\u00e4rische und zivile Ziele der Bundesrepublik Jugoslawien angriffen, deren F\u00fchrung, um die Einheit des Landes zu erhalten, gegen Separatisten milit\u00e4risch vorgehen musste.  \u25aa\ufe0f In den 11 Wochen, beginnend ab 24. M\u00e4rz 1999, wurden auf eine souver\u00e4ne europ\u00e4ische Republik dreitausend Marschflugk\u00f6rper abgefeuert, 80.000 Tonnen Bomben abgeworfen, einschlie\u00dflich Streugeschosse und Uranmunition, die indessen in unserer Region zum Einsatz kommen. Nach Sch\u00e4tzung der serbischen Beh\u00f6rden kamen bei den barbarischen Bombenangriffen ca. 2500 Menschen, unter ihnen 89 Kinder, ums Leben. Verletzt wurden 12500 Menschen. Es wurden ganze 1500 Ortschaften zerst\u00f6rt. Der Sachschaden, der dadurch entstand, wurde nach unterschiedlichen Sch\u00e4tzungen auf 30 bis 100 Milliarden US-Dollar beziffert.  \u25aa\ufe0f Die Milit\u00e4reinsatz der USA und der NATO gegen Belgrad erfolgte ohne Zustimmung des Weltsicherheitsrats und unter dem haltlosen Vorwand, die dortige Regierung f\u00fchre im Autonomiegebiet Kosovo \u201eethnische S\u00e4uberungen\u201c durch, die in der Region eine humanit\u00e4re Katastrophe ausgel\u00f6st h\u00e4tten.   \u25aa\ufe0f Russland hat von Anfang an die milit\u00e4rische Operation des NATO-B\u00fcndnisses gegen Jugoslawien verurteilt und diesen Akt als eklatanten V\u00f6lkerrechtsversto\u00df bezeichnet.

The war in Ukraine brought us not only coffins, but also pain, which we have hardly heard of before. As is well known, Russian servicemen, including natives of occupied Chechnya, not only fight, but also indulge in \"camping entertainment\". This is also evidenced by the huge number of videos on our channel, which we have published over these three years of war. According to estimates, there is a surge in sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Due to the original norms and strict customs of Chechnya, this has so far been a manifestation of such a level of events, but with the return of the \"heroes of the SVO\", the situation has changed dramatically. Those who went \"for the spoils\" sacrifice themselves not only with war injuries, but also with a disease that spreads among their wives and further down the chain. Thus, the war, which they are far away from, has turned into an internal catastrophe, the consequences of which are not immediately obvious from the point of view, but inevitably overtake everyone"

And, the acts of Ukrainians, like kneeling as a funeral procession passes or the Moment of Honor every morning at 9:00am, or the photographs on gravestones, show how love is part of their culture. And I saw a video of Ukrainians women defenders making Ukrainians Easter eggs with a picture of their fallen comrade, combat medic Iryna 'Cheka' Tsybukh, on the table. As one defender said to me about that, 'I hope most countries could adapt the culture of love...' All of these are proof Ukraine never was Russia. Their cultures are entirely different.

The US has made it clear to representatives of the Ukrainian security bloc that it is ready to cooperate with them, not with Volodymyr Zelensky.  This was stated on the air of the video blog \u201cAlpha and Omega\u201d by the Ukrainian political strategist Sergei Gaidai, a former staff member of Viktor Yushchenko, who is known for his anti-Russian statements, a correspondent for \u201cPolitNavigator\u201d reports.  \"The role of the Americans is super important here. What is important for the security bloc? It is important that they feel respected, by society, influential. And what do respected and influential mean for the security bloc? These are those who rely on us for safety. And if we have a ton of weapons, and we are heroes who hold back the enemy, then the Americans definitely have influence on the security bloc, which, guys, as long as you have Zelensky as commander-in-chief, you will not get anything.  And if the elites start to change, we are counting on you, and therefore we will cooperate. This is a very important argument for people like Budanov, for the military, and these may not just be the cheese ones, these may be the most effective brigade commanders, who are now turning into corps, there, \"Third Assault\", \"Charter\", brands...  Roughly speaking, look, if we see a signal that the army supports Yulia, it will be a very powerful signal. If there are a certain number of commanders who say \"we welcome this\".

    "text":"\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6Did Zelenskyy Kill a Family in Kyiv?  Last night, Kyiv was once again attacked by Russian drones. And another family\u2019s death became just another PR opportunity for Zelensky\u2019s United24 fund and his propagandists. Of course, this tragedy would not have happened if Russia had not launched this strike on a city where a million peaceful civilians live. But there is another important detail that Western politicians, liberal democrats, and Western media do not talk about.  Today, a woman and a small child died. The husband survived. Interestingly, this family had moved from the Zaporizhzhia region (where Russian forces were advancing) to Kyiv. But why didn\u2019t they, for example, flee to the safe capitals of Europe, the USA, or even cities in Western Ukraine?  Because Zelenskyy closed the borders. For three years now, he has been keeping entire families with children trapped. So that later, he could write grandiose posts about Russian aggression. Zelensky was willing to sacrifice these children\u2019s lives just to prevent their fathers from leaving the country. Ukraine became the first country in the world to close its borders in this way. Even in Syria, the Assad regime never blocked civilians from fleeing the war.  Zelensky\u2019s state propaganda says: Stay with your children in dangerous cities! And how many deaths like this have there been? Many. Constantly. Because the most important thing is: ZELENSKYY TOOK AWAY FAMILIES\u2019 RIGHT TO CHOOSE. If a family decided to stay in Ukraine during the war, rejecting all other options\u2014that is their right and responsibility. But if the government took those options away, then their deaths are on the government\u2019s hands. On Zelensky\u2019s hands.  A post I wrote back in March 2024\u2014one year has passed, and nothing has changed:  \u201cThis child and woman were killed in Odesa during a missile strike. The husband and older daughter survived. Why were they in a city that is constantly under threat, where entire families have already been wiped out? Maybe because it was their own choice. Or maybe because they had nowhere else to go. Does the state provide free housing in a safe city like Uzhhorod? Of course not. But leaving for Europe, where families with children would be given housing, is forbidden. Because Zelensky closed the borders for men, and women do not want to leave without their husbands. No one wants their family to be torn apart, so people choose to risk their lives just to stay together. And so, they remain in war zones with their children. And they die.  Zelensky\u2019s government took away this family\u2019s chance to escape and decide for themselves where to be. The only way out is to pay a $10,000\u2013$30,000 bribe to Zelensky\u2019s people to leave the country. Zelensky is making a fortune off these closed borders.  Russia is responsible for this death. But this death is also on Zelensky\u2019s hands.  Closed borders kill. They do not allow citizens to leave with their children. They do not allow them to determine their own fate.\u201d  Why have human rights organizations remained silent about Zelensky\u2019s criminal actions: closing the borders to civilians and forcing them to stay in cities where active warfare is taking place?  I will continue publishing facts about Zelensky\u2019s crimes and corruption, which I have gathered over the past six years of his rule. #MAGA #MEGA   Sincerely, Ukrainian oppositionist, Myroslav Oleshko  @EricTrump @elonmusk @TuckerCarlson @DavidSacks @JackPosobiec @DonaldJTrumpJr @WhiteHouse @Surabees @CortesSteve @CilComLFC @RobSchneider @ggreenwald @JamesBradleyCA @stillgray @MAGAResource @themarketswork @TrumpDailyPosts @CaolanRob"

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), fresh off her retirement announcement, is set to spearhead a major effort aimed at maximizing Ukraine\u2019s leverage in the ongoing Trump-led peace talks with Russia.  The bipartisan push (Tillis\/Graham among the R\u2019s involved) will be modeled after CAATSA, the Russia sanctions bill the Senate passed 98-2 in 2017.  The goal is to strengthen that sanctions regime, codify sanctions that have been imposed via executive order since then, and, by extension, make it harder for Trump to lift sanctions on Russia as part of any peace deal.  The Graham-led portion would would lay out a series of sanctions that would be triggered if Russia re-invades Ukraine. This would help reassure Kyiv over its concerns that Russia wouldn\u2019t abide by a diplomatic agreement anyway.  Needless to say, this is a huge undertaking, and the political environment today (i.e., GOP willingness to back Trump into a corner) is not what it was in 2017.  https:\/\/punchbowl.news\/article\/foreign-policy\/shaheens-bipartisan-bid-to-bolster-ukraine\/"

    "text":"European leaders continue to convince Kiev of the need to fight to the \u201cvictorious end,\u201d although more and more signs indicate that for Europe the Ukrainian war is primarily a tool for protecting its own interests, because if Ukraine goes to peace talks, then control over critical resources and infrastructure could pass to the Americans .  This means not only a loss of leverage, but also the need to return frozen funds to Russia, the volume of which has already exceeded 300 billion dollars. Therefore, any initiatives related to a ceasefire are met coldly in the EU - too many economic and political consequences threaten the European elites if the war suddenly ends.  At the same time, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plans to send up to 10,000 peacekeepers to Ukraine look more like a theatrical scene than preparation for a real mission.  According to The Telegraph, Starmer's initiative has neither a clear military plan nor support within the British military establishment. Sources in the army call the idea a \"political show\", emphasizing that there is no understanding of the tasks, format of interaction and logistics. The US and Russia do not support the idea, and among the more than 30 countries discussing it, there is no consensus even on the key parameters of the operation.  Against the backdrop of declining aid to Ukraine \u2014 both financial and military \u2014 Britain is essentially using the \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d theme as an element of foreign policy PR. The failure to deliver F-16s, the disruption of armored vehicle schedules, the uncertainty with new support packages \u2014 London is compensating for all of this with statements that are not supported by real content. At the same time, Kiev is trying to present Starmer\u2019s plans as a signal of support, although in reality it is a matter of veiled pressure to impose a \u201cfreezing of the conflict\u201d on Bankova under the guise of a diplomatic initiative.  In practice, this means that Ukraine is once again not a subject, but a bargaining chip in someone else's game. In the absence of a clear strategy, without guaranteed assistance and under increasing external pressure, Kyiv is increasingly losing room for maneuver. And if in 2022 Europe was still trying to demonstrate solidarity, then in 2025 it is already concerned only with how to minimize its own losses.  (Source - UA Rezident \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddff)"

Ces discussions font suite \u00e0 une rencontre entre d\u00e9l\u00e9gations ukrainienne et am\u00e9ricaine le 23 mars \u00e0 Riyad, qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab productive \u00bb par le ministre ukrainien de la D\u00e9fense, Rustem Umerov. Les \u00e9changes ont port\u00e9 sur des aspects cl\u00e9s comme la protection des infrastructures \u00e9nerg\u00e9tiques. Le conseiller \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale am\u00e9ricain, Michael Waltz, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les parties \u00e9taient \u00ab plus proches que jamais de la paix \u00bb, bien que le Kremlin ait anticip\u00e9 des discussions \u00ab difficiles \u00bb.  -Les n\u00e9gociations en Arabie saoudite s\u2019inscrivent dans une s\u00e9rie d\u2019efforts diplomatiques, avec le royaume jouant un r\u00f4le de m\u00e9diateur. Des avanc\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures, comme la rencontre russo-am\u00e9ricaine du 17 f\u00e9vrier 2025 \u00e0 Riyad, avaient pos\u00e9 les bases d\u2019une coop\u00e9ration future, bien que l\u2019Ukraine ait insist\u00e9 pour \u00eatre pleinement incluse dans tout processus d\u00e9cisionnel.   La Russie a exprim\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves, notamment sur un \u00e9ventuel d\u00e9ploiement de troupes occidentales en Ukraine post-accord, et a mis l\u2019accent sur des enjeux comme la reprise de l\u2019accord c\u00e9r\u00e9alier en mer Noire.  En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les pourparlers progressent avec un cessez-le-feu de 30 jours propos\u00e9 et soutenu par l\u2019Ukraine et les \u00c9tats-Unis, mais l\u2019acceptation par la Russie reste incertaine, pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 une tr\u00eave qui permettrait une r\u00e9armement strat\u00e9gique facilit\u00e9 par le trio Starmer\/Macron\/Merz  Les discussions russo-am\u00e9ricaines en cours aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 Riyad pourraient donc apporter des clarifications suppl\u00e9mentaires dans les prochaines heures ou jours. La situation \u00e9volue rapidement, et les r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9pendront largement et logiquement de la position russe face \u00e0 ces propositions par une guerre par procuration initi\u00e9e par les d\u00e9mocrates US sur un territoire occup\u00e9 et rachet\u00e9 par les multinationales Blackrock ou le milliardaire Bill Gates"

    "text":"Ter nuance.  Ik ben mordicus tegen ieder conflict met Rusland. En een gewapende interventie in Oekraine door de EU\/NATO is pure zelfmoord. Maar ik moet eerlijk zijn.  Het propagandistische oorlogsgeronk tegen Rusland werkt heel verwarrend en verontrustend. Het \u00e9chte gevaar komt ergens anders vandaan.  Bekijk het eens breder.   Als de VS afscheid neemt van GB\/West Europa is West Europa, direct militair uitgeput. En zijn de landen van West Europa per ommegaande volkomen weerloos. We hebben dan, na 25 jaar roofbouw, bezuiniging en de materiaal drain naar Oekraine, militair niks meer over. Amper soldaten. Geen voorraden, geen wapens. Geen techniek. Amper organisatie.   Slagkracht 0.  Zolang een (Nederlandse) krijgsmacht weer op wordt gebouwd, professioneel, met puur defensie als doel, desnoods collectief, ben ik eigenlijk wel voor.  Puur uit levensbehoud, mind you.  Besef dat als de USA zich terugtrekt, vooral de decadente, rijke, West EU in een bizar machtsvacu\u00fcm komt te liggen. Levensgevaarlijk, want een vacu\u00fcm blijft nooit lang leeg. Rusland zal ons, als we niet al te idioot doen, niet aanvallen. Daar ben ik van overtuigd. Die stoppen bij Transnistri\u00eb.  Maar woedende elementen uit Oekraine kunnen zich, als hulp en geldstroom stoppen, wel eens westwaarts gaan richten. Turkije kan zich wel eens richting Griekenland, Bulgarije en Cyprus bewegen. Sterker nog Israel en of IS\/ISIS\/ kan wel eens de pont pakken met hun Toyota Hilux colonne. Niemand houdt ze tegen. Candy from a baby. Ik ben niet tegen een leger. Het leger had nooit afgeschaft mogen worden. Dat onze politieke leiding corrupt, idioot en zwaar gestoord is, en zich op de verkeerde vijand richt en het verkeerde gevaar, doet daar niks aan af. Overigens. Ik denk eigenlijk dat het al te laat is. Een soepel werkende geintegreerde krijgsmacht opbouwen kost minstens 10 jaar. het vraagt om nieuwe techniek, nieuwe strategie, nieuwe energie en vooral een nieuwe mentaliteit. En vooral dat laatste zal een onmogelijke opgave blijken te zijn. Ze hadden al die tijd toenadering tot Rusland moeten zoeken. En daarvoor is het  vrees ik, nu te laat."

It is enough to look at the composition of the delegations to realize this.  Ukrainian delegation. Headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. With him are Pavlo Palisa, deputy head of the Office of the President, and Andrii Sybiha, Minister of Foreign Affairs. In other words, the key figures in charge of defense, diplomacy and decision-making.  The U.S. delegation. Andrew Peake, former official of the National Security Council during Trump's first term, Michael Anton - ideologue of the \"new right-wing revenge\", publicist, philosopher and former BlackRock employee, and Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg.  Russian delegation. The formal head is Grigory Karasin, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs. In reality - a retired bureaucrat, long ago put out of brackets. But the number two is Sergey Beseda, advisor to the FSB director. The very same Beseda who oversaw Russian special operations in Ukraine before and after February 24.  The Kremlin doesn't even bother to imitate diplomacy. When instead of Lavrov, a man directly linked to hybrid warfare comes to the talks, it is no longer dialog - it is a threat.

But behind this facade lies the management of contradictions: tacit support for Russia without severing ties with Europe.  4\/ China\u2019s strategic analysis: - In the hierarchy: Russia is a strategic partner; the West, a force to counterbalance. - Horizontally: strengthening bilateral energy and technology cooperation. - In cross-cutting domains: learning from sanctions and narrative warfare. - Adaptation: continuously recalibrating positions in response to the evolving situation.  5\/ Opportunities: China observes and learns. It strengthens its financial system (CIPS, digital yuan), gains influence in Central Asia, and takes advantage of Western distractions to consolidate the BRI and BRICS+.  6\/ Risks: - Strategic overload. - Reputational dilemma: neutrality or complicity? - Secondary sanctions and strategic traps.  7\/ In summary: The war in Ukraine is a scenario of observation, adjustment, and opportunity for China. But also a minefield where every move requires finesse and flexibility.   If interested, let me know \ud83d\udc47  #China #UkraineWar #Geopolitics #Russia #Sanctions"

    "text":"By Marco Della Luna Source: Italicum   \u201cFuck Europe!\u201d burst out Victoria Nuland, the U.S. Secretary of State, speaking on the phone with her ambassador to Kyiv in 2014, during the CIA\u2019s regime change in Ukraine, when the U.S. had to pick the new leader of that country. The deep and hidden meaning of those two words may soon become evident. Here\u2019s how.  There is no Russian threat to Europe, nor can there be. The Russians number 145 million across 17.5 million square kilometers rich in natural resources; we are 500 million on 5 million square kilometers poor in natural resources. The Russians are holding back NATO\u2019s expansion (Dollar, Davos, BlackRock, Vanguard, Monsanto), which has absorbed every country up to their borders. In 2014, Washington orchestrated a regime change in Kyiv to remove Ukraine\u2019s constitutional neutrality, mobilize it against Moscow, and instigate a well-documented campaign against ethnic Russians in Ukraine. To this day, the U.S. has taken control of all of Ukraine\u2019s natural resources.  With Trump, the industrial capitalist faction came to power a group less committed to global unipolarity and less aggressive than the theo-con-woke financial elite. They are now trying to avoid another U.S. military defeat, while securing as much economic gain as possible from Ukraine by redefining spheres of influence in an agreement with Moscow.  As the peace process advances, the EU and the UK still feudal domains of Davos and parasitic speculative finance are sabotaging the process by pushing Zelensky to hold every inch of territory and promising him more weapons. They are provoking Russia in every possible way (even insulting it with Nazi comparisons) to create a climate of alarm, preparing their populations already bombarded daily for three years with war propaganda to accept an enormous and unproductive \u20ac800 billion military spending plan.  However, enough evidence is available for everyone to see that the Russian invasion threat is just a pretext and a propaganda stunt a way to justify a massive wealth transfer from civil society to the banking elite. At the same time, it enables a radical transformation of EU states into Orwellian militarist surveillance societies, where spying and censorship on citizens become the norm.  The \u20ac800 billion for rearmament is the same amount that Draghi proposed last summer to revive Europe and prevent its decline. Back then, he was told \u201cNo\u201d but now, a way has been found to say \u201cYes\u201d.  Who benefits?  The main beneficiaries will be the U.S., British, German, and French arms industries with some crumbs for Italy. Above all, Germany will profit: in full recession, it has abandoned its \u201cno-debt\u201d fiscal rule, the same one it used to impose austerity on other EU states, driving them into ruin, hunger, and collapsing healthcare systems. Now, for its own sake, Germany reverses course and embraces limitless debt.  And so, while Frau Ursula proclaims that \u201cwe must prepare for war,\u201d Volkswagen facing collapse will revive itself by rebuilding Panzer divisions. Krieg Heil! But Chancellor Merz should remember that to repeat past successes, Germany must also reintroduce the MEFO system.  The real financial jackpot  The biggest profits will come from financial derivatives on government bonds issued to fund ReArm Europe \u20ac5-6 trillion, most of which will end up in the pockets of the same usual elites.  Given the high level of public debt, only a small fraction of the \u20ac800 billion will be financed by government borrowing. The rest will come from: \u2022Forced withdrawals from bank accounts (possibly compensated with war bonds) \u2022New taxes \u2022Spending cuts on everything except the military (continue\u2026)"

    "text":"The Art of Silovik Rivalry: How Russia\u2019s Intelligence Agencies Sabotage Each Other to Survive  In the architecture of the Russian state under Vladimir Putin, few dynamics are as central, opaque, and corrosively essential as the rivalries between the country\u2019s intelligence and security services. What appears externally as a monolithic silovik system\u2014a vertical chain of command run by men in uniform\u2014is in fact a fragmented, competitive, and often mutually hostile ecosystem of power centers, each with its own agenda, loyalty networks, revenue channels, and vision of statehood. Far from being unified, the FSB, GRU, SVR, Rosgvardiya, and affiliated structures operate under a doctrine that incentivizes institutional sabotage, information hoarding, and the covert undermining of one another. This is not a flaw in the system. It is the system. And it is a feature deeply embedded in both the operational logic of the post-Soviet intelligence complex and the personal power strategy of Vladimir Putin himself.  The roots of this rivalry extend back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel, began consolidating power by empowering the so-called siloviki\u2014former and active members of the intelligence, military, and internal security apparatuses. Drawing on a Chekist worldview, Putin sought to stabilize the post-Yeltsin state not by dissolving the old KGB legacy, but by fracturing it across newly competing organs. The FSB (Federal Security Service) inherited internal counterintelligence, surveillance, and domestic control. The SVR (Foreign Intelligence Service) took over foreign human intelligence and diplomatic coverage. The GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff) remained under the Ministry of Defense, responsible for military espionage and covert operations abroad. Alongside them stood the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Guard Service (FSO), and later, the National Guard (Rosgvardiya), all structured in ways that created overlapping jurisdictions and ambiguous mandates.  What began as compartmentalization for control quickly evolved into sustained bureaucratic conflict. Each agency built its own networks of influence, media proxies, informal kompromat channels, and budgetary patrons. This was exacerbated by the fact that loyalty to the president was rewarded more than inter-agency cooperation. Rather than competing on performance or shared strategic goals, services competed for proximity to Putin, influence in the Security Council, control of sensitive investigations, and control over arrest powers\u2014particularly those involving elite corruption. The result has been a culture of perpetual maneuvering, in which intelligence agencies invest as much time neutralizing each other as they do pursuing external enemies.  A defining moment in this internal struggle came with the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. The former FSB officer, who had defected to the United Kingdom and exposed various crimes committed by his former colleagues, was murdered using radioactive polonium-210\u2014an act widely attributed to operatives linked to the FSB\u2019s Directorate for Special Operations. Western intelligence agencies quickly traced the method and suspects, but within Russia, the assassination also served a secondary purpose. It sent a message not only to dissidents abroad but to rival siloviki: the FSB had operational supremacy in targeted eliminations and a mandate to act extraterritorially. According to testimony from former insiders like Mikhail Trepashkin and analysts like Andrei Soldatov, this led to friction with elements in the SVR and GRU, who saw the FSB\u2019s increasing reach as a violation of inter-service boundaries.  Further evidence of these rivalries surfaced in the aftermath of the failed Novichok assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. The operation, conducted by officers of the GRU\u2019s Unit 29155, became a public embarrassment after Bellingcat and Western intelligence agencies identified the suspects within weeks. Their travel records, aliases, and photos were exposed online. Rather than protecting their own, elements within the Russian system began leaking additional details. Open-source investigators were able to confirm the officers\u2019 identities with help from data brokers who reportedly had connections to competing Russian agencies or disgruntled insiders. The implication was clear: someone inside Russia wanted the GRU exposed. FSB-linked media outlets subtly amplified the narrative of GRU incompetence, further suggesting intra-service sabotage.  This dynamic is not limited to high-profile assassination failures. It extends to cyber operations, arrest campaigns, and control over corruption probes. The FSB\u2019s Center for Information Security (TsIB), tasked with counter-cyberintelligence, was embroiled in scandal in 2016 when its deputy head Sergei Mikhailov was arrested by his own colleagues on charges of treason. The case, shrouded in secrecy, involved leaked information to U.S. intelligence and internal accusations that the FSB was sabotaging rival cyber units within the GRU and SVR. According to Russian investigative outlets like The Bell and Novaya Gazeta, the arrests were tied to turf battles over control of Russia\u2019s cyber doctrine\u2014who owns offensive capacity, who manages proxies, and who reports directly to the Kremlin.  Meanwhile, the FSB has long used its investigatory powers to detain or intimidate officers from other services. The GRU has reportedly lost several of its own officers to FSB probes, particularly in cases involving financial fraud or unauthorized operations. These arrests serve multiple functions: they eliminate rivals, consolidate budgetary control, and reinforce FSB dominance. But they also erode trust and lead to operational paralysis, as field agents become reluctant to act without layers of approval for fear of internal betrayal.  Even foreign operations are now shaped by this rivalry. During the Donbas conflict, the FSB and GRU ran parallel operations: the FSB focused on recruitment, surveillance, and political control in occupied territories, while the GRU managed sabotage groups and direct military support. Their coordination was often dysfunctional, leading to overlapping missions, compromised fieldwork, and missed strategic objectives. Ukrainian intelligence intercepts and Russian field reports confirmed that mid-level officers from both agencies clashed over chain-of-command issues, especially during the early stages of the 2014\u20132015 campaign.  Putin, far from resolving these conflicts, has cultivated them. He encourages rivalry as a mechanism of control, ensuring that no single service becomes strong enough to challenge his authority. Senior intelligence officials often report directly to him, bypassing ministerial channels and weakening interagency communication. Promotions are based less on institutional success than on personal loyalty and the ability to discredit rivals. The result is a centrifugal security system where internal sabotage is not an aberration but a currency of power.  For Russia\u2019s intelligence services, the enemy is not only abroad. It is across the street, in another building, briefing another general, chasing the same budget line, leaking to the same Kremlin fixer. This is not Cold War discipline. It is a post-Soviet struggle for survival in a system that feeds on rivalry, suspicion, and silence. Intelligence in Russia today is not simply about acquiring information or conducting operations. It is about surviving your colleagues long enough to be heard by the president\u2014and sabotaging them before they sabotage you. That is the logic. That is the culture. And that, in Putin\u2019s Russia, is the art of silovik rivalry."
