"Nach seinem Treffen mit Putin sagte Steve Witkoff in der Sendung von Tucker Carlson am 21.03.25, Putin sei ein guter K√ºsser. Auch wenn er etwas nach Urin rieche. Ok, eigentlich sagte er, dass ‚ñ∂Ô∏èRussland zu ‚Äû100 Prozent‚Äú nicht Europa √ºberfallen wolle (was es 2014 und 2022 getan hat und noch tut) ‚ñ∂Ô∏è es f√ºnf Regionen ‚Äûzur√ºckerobert‚Äú habe (was es nicht hat, da es die Gebiete nicht vollst√§ndig kontrolliert und da sie Russland nicht geh√∂rt haben) ‚ñ∂Ô∏è und dass Russland erreicht habe, was es wolle (was es nicht hat, da seine Grundforderungen bis heute weitreichender sind). Warum Russland dann nicht zu Verhandlungen bereit ist, sagte er nicht. Der Wahrheitsgehalt ist also ungef√§hr identisch. Witkoff ist √ºbrigens Trumps Sonderbeauftragte f√ºr den Nahen Osten, hat also eigentlich mit der Ukraine gar nichts zu tun. Er ist Trumps Golfpartner und hat keinerlei diplomatische Erfahrung. Und er ist Immobilienmogul, seine S√∂hne haben eine Firma f√ºr Kryptow√§hrung von Trump mitbegr√ºndet. Carlson ist ein reichweitenstarker Erz√§hler von (antisemitischen) Verschw√∂rungsmythen, Coronagefasel und anderem Zeug, bis hin zu Au√üerirdischen. Nachdem die Trump-freundlichen Fox News sich wegen Verbreitung von Falschinformationen 2023 auf einen Vergleich von 787 Millionen Dollar geeinigt hatten, wurde er selbst denen zu krass und gefeuert. Zumal er in privaten Nachrichten g√§nzlich andere Positionen vertrat als Trump, was durch das Verfahren herauskam. Er hatte jedoch auch danach einen starken Einfluss auf Trumps Wahlkampf und hat alleine auf YouTube fast vier Millionen Follower. Willkommen in der neuen, alternativen Realit√§t.",0

". @michaeljohns lays out an excellent timeline of events that occurred over 24 years leading up to Russia's most recent invasion of Ukraine.   Before these events, which you should read, because I offer no redundancies, Ukraine had been part of Russia dating back to the 9th century. Kyiv is where the Nazis first attacked Russia in WWII.   After WWII, Ukraine became a part of the Soviet Bloc. When that broke up, instead of embracing Russia as we should have, we took advantage of it, as Michael lays out.   At the same time, Russia made Ukraine an autonomous state of Russia. Like Catalonia in Spain. During Bush's tenure, our CIA meddled in Ukraine's elections, which drove the first Russian incursion; from all indications, it was welcomed.   I was living in Europe during the second invasion under Obama there was a large percentage of the population that saw the president as a U.S. puppet and wanted to be Russian. Eighty percent of Ukrainians speak Russian.   When Kamala went to Europe and said, Ukraine would become a part of NATO, that was Russia's red line. One that they had made crystal clear for a very long time.   One has to ask, why didn't we make peace with Russia instead threatening them the way Michael laid out below.",0

"üá∫üá∏üá∫üá¶Did Zelenskyy Kill a Family in Kyiv?  Last night, Kyiv was once again attacked by Russian drones. And another family‚Äôs death became just another PR opportunity for Zelensky‚Äôs United24 fund and his propagandists. Of course, this tragedy would not have happened if Russia had not launched this strike on a city where a million peaceful civilians live. But there is another important detail that Western politicians, liberal democrats, and Western media do not talk about.  Today, a woman and a small child died. The husband survived. Interestingly, this family had moved from the Zaporizhzhia region (where Russian forces were advancing) to Kyiv. But why didn‚Äôt they, for example, flee to the safe capitals of Europe, the USA, or even cities in Western Ukraine?  Because Zelenskyy closed the borders. For three years now, he has been keeping entire families with children trapped. So that later, he could write grandiose posts about Russian aggression. Zelensky was willing to sacrifice these children‚Äôs lives just to prevent their fathers from leaving the country. Ukraine became the first country in the world to close its borders in this way. Even in Syria, the Assad regime never blocked civilians from fleeing the war.  Zelensky‚Äôs state propaganda says: Stay with your children in dangerous cities! And how many deaths like this have there been? Many. Constantly. Because the most important thing is: ZELENSKYY TOOK AWAY FAMILIES‚Äô RIGHT TO CHOOSE. If a family decided to stay in Ukraine during the war, rejecting all other options‚Äîthat is their right and responsibility. But if the government took those options away, then their deaths are on the government‚Äôs hands. On Zelensky‚Äôs hands.  A post I wrote back in March 2024‚Äîone year has passed, and nothing has changed:  ‚ÄúThis child and woman were killed in Odesa during a missile strike. The husband and older daughter survived. Why were they in a city that is constantly under threat, where entire families have already been wiped out? Maybe because it was their own choice. Or maybe because they had nowhere else to go. Does the state provide free housing in a safe city like Uzhhorod? Of course not. But leaving for Europe, where families with children would be given housing, is forbidden. Because Zelensky closed the borders for men, and women do not want to leave without their husbands. No one wants their family to be torn apart, so people choose to risk their lives just to stay together. And so, they remain in war zones with their children. And they die.  Zelensky‚Äôs government took away this family‚Äôs chance to escape and decide for themselves where to be. The only way out is to pay a $10,000‚Äì$30,000 bribe to Zelensky‚Äôs people to leave the country. Zelensky is making a fortune off these closed borders.  Russia is responsible for this death. But this death is also on Zelensky‚Äôs hands.  Closed borders kill. They do not allow citizens to leave with their children. They do not allow them to determine their own fate.‚Äù  Why have human rights organizations remained silent about Zelensky‚Äôs criminal actions: closing the borders to civilians and forcing them to stay in cities where active warfare is taking place?  I will continue publishing facts about Zelensky‚Äôs crimes and corruption, which I have gathered over the past six years of his rule. #MAGA #MEGA   Sincerely, Ukrainian oppositionist, Myroslav Oleshko  @EricTrump @elonmusk @TuckerCarlson @DavidSacks @JackPosobiec @DonaldJTrumpJr @WhiteHouse @Surabees @CortesSteve @CilComLFC @RobSchneider @ggreenwald @JamesBradleyCA @stillgray @MAGAResource @themarketswork @TrumpDailyPosts @CaolanRob",2

"News: Sen.

The bipartisan push (Tillis/Graham among the R‚Äôs involved) will be modeled after CAATSA, the Russia sanctions bill the Senate passed 98-2 in 2017.  The goal is to strengthen that sanctions regime, codify sanctions that have been imposed via executive order since then, and, by extension, make it harder for Trump to lift sanctions on Russia as part of any peace deal.  The Graham-led portion would would lay out a series of sanctions that would be triggered if Russia re-invades Ukraine. This would help reassure Kyiv over its concerns that Russia wouldn‚Äôt abide by a diplomatic agreement anyway.

And now our politicians want to send troops to Ukraine over a historical baggage conflict ü§¶.The Ukraine-Russia war stinks; we should stay out of it! - 68% speak Russian fluently; 30% native language. - 1654 to 1917: Part of Russia. - 1917 to 1991: Part of the USSR,1
"Unfortunately, America has become complicit in genocide, now.  We must back Ukraine again, fully.  These massive attacks by Russia on civilians in Sumy, in Odesa, in Kherson, in Zaporizhzhia, in Kharkiv, in Kyiv, are all proof of the inhumanity of Russia.  And, the acts of Ukrainians, like kneeling as a funeral procession passes or the Moment of Honor every morning at 9:00am, or the photographs on gravestones, show how love is part of their culture.  And I saw a video of Ukrainians women defenders making Ukrainians Easter eggs with a picture of their fallen comrade, combat medic Iryna 'Cheka' Tsybukh, on the table.  As one defender said to me about that, 'I hope most countries could adapt the culture of love...'  All of these are proof Ukraine never was Russia. Their cultures are entirely different.  Humanity could learn a lot from Ukraine and Ukrainians on how you keep all of your countrymen and women present today even when they have been lost in this war. It isn't just memory, it is presence, real and current. It is awe inspiring, truly.  #ArmUkraine #Sanctions on #Russia. #DefeatRussia #StandWithUkraine.",2

"Ter nuance. Ik ben mordicus tegen ieder conflict met Rusland. En een gewapende interventie in Oekraine door de EU/NATO is pure zelfmoord. Maar ik moet eerlijk zijn. Het propagandistische oorlogsgeronk tegen Rusland werkt heel verwarrend en verontrustend. Het √©chte gevaar komt ergens anders vandaan. Bekijk het eens breder. Als de VS afscheid neemt van GB/West Europa is West Europa, direct militair uitgeput. En zijn de landen van West Europa per ommegaande volkomen weerloos. We hebben dan, na 25 jaar roofbouw, bezuiniging en de materiaal drain naar Oekraine, militair niks meer over. Amper soldaten. Geen voorraden, geen wapens. Geen techniek. Amper organisatie. Slagkracht 0. Zolang een (Nederlandse) krijgsmacht weer op wordt gebouwd, professioneel, met puur defensie als doel, desnoods collectief, ben ik eigenlijk wel voor. Puur uit levensbehoud, mind you. Besef dat als de USA zich terugtrekt, vooral de decadente, rijke, West EU in een bizar machtsvacu√ºm komt te liggen. Levensgevaarlijk, want een vacu√ºm blijft nooit lang leeg. Rusland zal ons, als we niet al te idioot doen, niet aanvallen. Daar ben ik van overtuigd. Die stoppen bij Transnistri√´. Maar woedende elementen uit Oekraine kunnen zich, als hulp en geldstroom stoppen, wel eens westwaarts gaan richten. Turkije kan zich wel eens richting Griekenland, Bulgarije en Cyprus bewegen. Sterker nog Israel en of IS/ISIS/ kan wel eens de pont pakken met hun Toyota Hilux colonne. Niemand houdt ze tegen. Candy from a baby. Ik ben niet tegen een leger. Het leger had nooit afgeschaft mogen worden. Dat onze politieke leiding corrupt, idioot en zwaar gestoord is, en zich op de verkeerde vijand richt en het verkeerde gevaar, doet daar niks aan af. Overigens. Ik denk eigenlijk dat het al te laat is. Een soepel werkende geintegreerde krijgsmacht opbouwen kost minstens 10 jaar. het vraagt om nieuwe techniek, nieuwe strategie, nieuwe energie en vooral een nieuwe mentaliteit. En vooral dat laatste zal een onmogelijke opgave blijken te zijn. Ze hadden al die tijd toenadering tot Rusland moeten zoeken. En daarvoor is het vrees ik, nu te laat.",0
